# Fitness_Tracker_App
My final capstone project for the Software Engineering Bootcamp. A basic fitness tracker app built with Python and SQL.
This program allows users to:
  - add, view, and delete exercises in the database.
  - add, view, and track workout routines to the database.
  - set up fitness goals and track the set fitness goals.

The database was built with SQlite3 and Python.
